            <h2>Lecture 1: Introduction to Differential Equations</h2>
            
            <h3>What is a Differential Equation?</h3>
            <p>An equation that expresses a relationship between functions, their derivatives, and variables is known as a differential equation. For example, a function \(y\) depends on a variable \(x\).</p>
            
            <h3>Classification of Differential Equations</h3>
            <p>Differential equations (DEs) can be classified into two main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):</strong> An ODE is a DE where the dependent variable (e.g., \(y\)) is dependent on only one independent variable (e.g., \(x\)). The general form is \(F(x,y,y',y'',y'''...) = 0\).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin x + \cos x\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):</strong> A PDE is a DE where the dependent variable (e.g., \(y\)) is dependent on two or more independent variables (e.g., \(x, t\)). The general form is \(F(x,t,y,\frac{\partial y}{\partial x},\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}, ...) = 0\).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: \(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} + t\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 2y\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Order and Degree of a Differential Equation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Order:</strong> The order of a DE is defined as the order of the highest derivative present in the equation.</li>
                <li><strong>Degree:</strong> The degree of a DE is the power of the highest-order derivative after the equation has been cleared of any radicals and fractions with respect to the derivatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <details>
                <summary>Examples: Find the Order and Degree</summary>
                <div class="solution">
                    <p>1. \(\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = 0\)</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Order = 2, Degree = 1.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>2. \(\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + m^2y = 0\)</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Order = 2, Degree = 1.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>3. \(y=x\frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{a}{\frac{dy}{dx}}\)</p>
                    <p><strong>Steps:</strong> First, clear the fraction by multiplying by \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). This gives \(y\frac{dy}{dx} = x(\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + a\). The highest derivative is \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (order 1), and its highest power is 2.<br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Order = 1, Degree = 2.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>4. \(y\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} - (\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = y^2 \log y\)</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Order = 2, Degree = 1.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>5. \([1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^{2}]^{3/2}=a\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}\)</p>
                    <p><strong>Steps:</strong> Square both sides to remove the radical: \([1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^{2}]^{3}=a^2(\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}})^2\). The highest derivative is \(\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}\) (order 2), and its power is 2.<br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Order = 2, Degree = 2.</p>

            <h3>Formation and Solution of DEs</h3>
            <p>DEs are formed to eliminate arbitrary constants from an equation. A key principle is that the <strong>order of the resulting DE is equal to the number of constants</strong> to be eliminated.</p>
            
            <details>
                <summary>Example: Form a DE from \(y = ax^2 + bx\)</summary>
                <div class="solution">
                    <p>The equation has two constants, \(a\) and \(b\). So we need a 2nd order DE.</p>
                    <p>1. Differentiate once: \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 2ax + b\).</p>
                    <p>2. Differentiate again: \(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2a\).</p>
                    <p>3. From step 2, we get \(a = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\).</p>
                    <p>4. Substitute \(a\) back into the first derivative to find \(b\): \(b = \frac{dy}{dx} - 2ax = \frac{dy}{dx} - x\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\).</p>
                    <p>5. Substitute \(a\) and \(b\) back into the original equation: \(y = (\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})x^2 + (\frac{dy}{dx} - x\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})x\).</p>
                    <p>6. Simplifying gives the final DE: \(y = x\frac{dy}{dx} - \frac{1}{2}x^2\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\), which has order 2 and degree 1.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            
            <h3>Types of Solutions</h3>
            <p>A solution is a relation between variables that satisfies the DE.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Solution:</strong> A solution where the number of arbitrary constants equals the order of the DE. Ex: For \(\frac{dy}{dx}-2y=0\), the general solution is \(y=ce^{2x}\).</li>
                <li><strong>Particular Solution:</strong> Obtained from the general solution by assigning specific values to the constants. Ex: \(y=2e^{2x}\) is a particular solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Singular Solution:</strong> A solution that is neither general nor particular. Only some equations have them. Ex: For \((\frac{dy}{dx})^2 - 4y = 0\), \(y=0\) is a singular solution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>First Order, First Degree DEs</h3>
            <p>These equations are of the form \(F(x, y(x), \frac{dy}{dx}) = 0\). They are classified into several types, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Variable Separable Equations</li>
                <li>Homogeneous Equations</li>
                <li>Linear DEs</li>
                <li>Exact Equations</li>
                <li>And equations reducible to these forms.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>1. Variable Separable Equations</h4>
            <p>If a DE can be rearranged so that all functions of \(x\) and \(dx\) are on one side, and all functions of \(y\) and \(dy\) are on the other, the variables are separable. The general form is \(f(x)dx = g(y)dy\). The solution is found by integrating both sides: \(\int f(x)dx = \int g(y)dy + c\).</p>
            
            <details>
                <summary>Example: Solve \((1-x)dy + (1-y)dx = 0\)</summary>
                <div class="solution">
                    <p>1. Rearrange the equation: \((1-x)dy = -(1-y)dx = (y-1)dx\).</p>
                    <p>2. Separate the variables: \(\frac{1}{y-1}dy = \frac{1}{1-x}dx\).</p>
                    <p>3. Integrate both sides: \(\int \frac{1}{y-1}dy = \int \frac{1}{1-x}dx\).</p>
                    <p>4. Result of integration: \(\log(y-1) = -\log(1-x) - c\).</p>
                    <p>5. Combine log terms: \(\log(y-1) + \log(1-x) = -c\), which gives \(\log((y-1)(1-x)) = -c\).</p>
                    <p>6. Exponentiate to get the general solution: \((y-1)(1-x) = e^{-c}\). Let \(A = e^{-c}\), so \((y-1)(1-x) = A\).</p>
